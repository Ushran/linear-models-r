# Further Statistical Analysis in R

## Description

The course will cover linear regression, ANOVA and non-parametric ANOVA. It will be a mixture of lectures and hands-on time using RStudio to analyse data.  By the end of this course you should be able to:


# Aims: During this course you will learn about: 

- ANOVA
- Assessing correlation between two variables
- Simple and multiple regression
- Generalised Linear Models

# Objectives: After this course you should be able to

- Select an appropriate test for analysing data
- Analyse data using linear regression
- Check the assumptions of linear regression are met by the data
- Check the fit of the linear regression model to your data
- Know when linear regression is not appropriate and have an idea of which alternative method might be appropriate
- Know how to check that the ANOVA assumptions are met by the data
- Analyse data using non-parametric ANOVA
- Know when you need to seek help with analysis as the data structure is too complex for the methods taught

# Pre-requisites

 This course assumes basic knowledge of statistics and use of R, which would be obtained from our Introductory Statistics Course and an "Introduction to R for Solving Biological Problems" run at the Genetics department (or equivalent).
